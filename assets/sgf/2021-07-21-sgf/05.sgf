B is situational, for when White needs to counteract a lot of Black influence from the left. It takes some fairly special circumstances for this to be worth it over A.](;W[rq]C[Locally, a pretty good outcome for White even after accounting for the extra stone. White did spend sente but is well compensated for it with the 1-2 sente exchange and the descent to 3. 3 is particularly big because it accomplishes many things: it fixes White's shape problems (which makes White 1 stronger as well), secures a decently-sized corner with little to no aji, devalues the bottom right side for Black, and robs Black's group of a potential base. Black may want to consider an extension if it doesn't have one already, because with White's shape problems fixed Black might have to start worrying about White pressuring this group.]LB[mq:1][np:2][rq:3])(;W[lr]LB[rq:A]))
