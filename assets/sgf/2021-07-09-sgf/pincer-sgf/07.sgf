Black's territory might seem large compared to White's, but Black has one more stone in the area so this is naturally better for Black locally.

Black's territory might seem large, and to be perfectly honest that is true. However, Black actually owes one more move locally at A or B to secure this territory: without it White's pincered stone is not completely out of the game just yet. As long as White plays around this fact, this is a playable position for White.]LB[om:A][qm:B]))
