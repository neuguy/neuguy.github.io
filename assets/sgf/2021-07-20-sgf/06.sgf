White has a fairly strong shape in the center which will support operations on the other side of the board. Black's territorial gains and fairly minor on the side, being pressed low and potentially subject to further pressing from above.

White settles in sente with good shape. The bottom right corner looks large, but invasion is still possible as well as the shoulder hit. Black, on the other hand, has a good chunk of secure territory and the marked stone makes a big difference in terms of how well White's group can erase Black's influence on the right.]TR[kp])))
