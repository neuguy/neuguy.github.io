The marked stones denote the new stones since the start of the invasion.

The loss of the side territory is not all that significant. There is no value in this territory for Black aside from making territory and denying it from White, as the bottom right corner did not need any further reinforcement. But this territory is mostly being made by crawling on the 2nd line, so it is not even large in terms of intrinsic value. In exchange White gets good thickness on the outside, the Q4-R3 sente exchange, and sente. As these stones are fairly safe this also neutralizes Black's top right corner, as White can invade or reduce without worrying about risking the safety of this group. This is likely to favor White in the early game, since that is when thickness and sente have the greatest value.]TR[pk][pl][pm][pp][qk][ql][qm][qq][rl][rm][rn])(;B[op];W[qq];B[rq];W[qr];B[rr];W[rn];B[rp]C[Black's greed has allowed White to make this descent in sente, removing the possibility of the marked stone connecting back to the corner.]TR[rl][rn]))
